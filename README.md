# TextAdventureGame

This is one of my first projects where I experiment with a programming language called C++, a language typically used in video game development. I made a text based adventure using this C++ with Visual Studios. The source files for the adventure is in ConsoleApplication 19. 

*Game Description*: 

A basic text adventure Game that follows the adventure of "You" the player.

You will explore new areas, dungeons, and villians as you work your way out of the mansion and away from the mafia! The game combines combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, interactive fiction, and online chat.

Are you ready to play?
